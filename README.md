# SKIP1103-PROJECT

How to solve the errors:
1. GUI.java > Design > Navigator > JFrame > panelMain > Set Layout > Absolute Layout
2. You need to have jCalendar-1.4.jar in your library(you can google how install this)
3. After installing it you need to drag jDateChooser into "panelAddBooking" and change the variable name to "bookingDate".
4. You can change your package name if you want.
5. You're done!
